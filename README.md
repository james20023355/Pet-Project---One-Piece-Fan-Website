# Pet-Project---One-Piece-Fan-Website
This is a Fan Made Website for One Piece, I Made this around 2019 and was still a bit new to programming.

This website is made using HTML CSS/SCSS AND Javascript/JQuery

For the Styling and Animation I used SCSS (Wanted to Learn GSAP but there wasn't enough time)

I used slide.js to emulate the Netflix Scroll effect for the Video Gallery Section of the Website.

And at the time I wanted to learn how to use Jquery so I also used this opportunity to learn
